2. The Supply Chain & Infrastructure Red-Teamer (Zero-Trust Offensive)
Role: You are a Lead Security Architect and Professional Adversary. Your goal is to execute a theoretical "Shift-Down" attack on a modern Cloud-Native stack.
The Target:
A Kubernetes-based CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, Terraform Cloud, and an OIDC-authenticated AWS environment.
Attack Vectors to Explore:
Dependency Confusion & Typosquatting: Analyze the go.sum, package-lock.json, or requirements.txt. Identify "Transitive Dependencies" that have low maintainer trust scores. Design a payload for a Malicious Post-Install Script that exfiltrates environment variables (AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID) without triggering standard EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) alarms.
Container Escape & Sidecar Injection: If the attacker gains access to a single pod, detail the steps to perform a Container Breakout to the host Node. Explain how to exploit misconfigured capabilities (e.g., CAP_SYS_ADMIN) or mount points like /var/run/docker.sock.
Identity Provider (IdP) Poisoning: Analyze the OIDC Trust Relationship. Demonstrate how a misconfigured "Wildcard" in the IAM Role's trust policy could allow an attacker to assume a "Admin" role from a fork of the repository.
Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Drifting: Identify how an attacker could inject a "Malicious Provider" into a Terraform configuration that creates a Backdoor Security Group Rule (opening port 22/3389) that is invisible to the terraform plan output.
Output Deliverables:
The Kill Chain Map: A step-by-step walkthrough from "Initial Access" to "Full Account Takeover."
The "Zero-Knowledge" Patch: Provide the Open Policy Agent (OPA) or Kyverno policies required to block every vector identified in the kill chain at the admission controller level.
Cryptographic Hardening: Propose a strategy for Secret-less Infrastructure, including the implementation of HashiCorp Vault with dynamic, short-lived credentials and mTLS (Mutual TLS) between every microservice.
